QUESTION:

    Where is the largest discrepancy in amino acid counts between the coding sequences (correct frame
    shift) and the whole genome sequence (random frame shift), and why?

ANSWER:

    Looking closely at the amino acid counts, the largest discrepancy is for Valine (Val):

        - Val count in coding sequences: 1152
        - Val count in whole genome: 548

    Valine has a much higher count in the coding sequences compared to the whole genome.

    The reasons for this discrepancy are:

        - There are 4 codons encoding Valine (GTT, GTC, GTA, GTG)
        - These Valine codons are more common in the correct reading frames of coding sequences,
          leading to high Val usage
        - The whole genome contains frameshift mutations disrupting Valine codons
        - This lowers the Valine codon count in the non-coding regions of the whole genome
